# Pure Question-Based Learning (pQBL)

This skill applies pure question-based learning principles integrated with variation theory of learning to structure educational materials where questions come first and all content is embedded in constructive feedback. Questions are designed to create patterns of variation that enable learners to discern critical aspects of what is being learned.

## Core Definition

pQBL is defined as "learning material that consists solely of questions with constructive formative feedback" (Bälter et al., 2024). Unlike traditional instruction, pQBL:
- Places questions **before** any content exposure
- Embeds all learning material **within feedback responses**
- Eliminates separate readings, lectures, or preparatory texts
- Makes active engagement the primary learning mechanism

## Theoretical Foundations

### Testing-First Research
Research since the 1950s demonstrates that attempting problems before receiving instruction produces better retention than traditional learn-then-practice sequences. Students benefit from attempting questions even when initially unsuccessful.

### Retrieval Practice
Cognitive psychology shows that retrieving information from memory through self-testing generates superior long-term retention compared to passive content consumption.

### Active Learning
Students learn more effectively through engagement and practice rather than passive reception of information.

### Historical Roots
pQBL represents "a digitized version" of Socratic teaching methods, emphasizing discovery through questioning.

### Variation Theory Integration
pQBL is most effective when combined with **variation theory of learning** (Marton & Pang, 2006) to determine what questions to ask and how to sequence them. Variation theory provides:

- **Framework for identifying critical aspects**: What learners must discern to understand the object of learning
- **Patterns for structuring questions**: Using contrast, separation, generalization, and fusion
- **Principles for feedback design**: Making variation and invariance explicit

The integration: **Variation theory identifies what to teach and in what order; pQBL determines how to structure that content as questions with embedded learning material.**

## Key Principles of pQBL

### 1. Questions First
Students encounter questions **without prerequisite reading material**. The question itself is the entry point to learning.

### 2. Content in Feedback
All learning material exists exclusively within feedback explanations. There are no separate texts, readings, or lectures.

### 3. Constructive Elaborated Feedback
Feedback must:
- Explain **why** answers are correct or incorrect, not merely verify
- Provide "instant elaborate feedback" tailored to each response
- Include the learning content that would traditionally appear in readings
- Be substantial enough to support learning independently

### 4. Modular Design
Break material into smaller, manageable units focused on discrete concepts or skills.

## Question Design Guidelines

### Using Variation Theory to Design Questions

Questions in pQBL should target **critical aspects** of the **object of learning** (what is to be learned) and create **patterns of variation** that enable discernment. Marton's principle: learners must experience **variation in one dimension against a background of invariance** in other dimensions.

#### The Four Patterns of Variation in pQBL

**1. Contrast Questions** (Early in sequence)
- **Purpose**: Help learners recognize that a critical aspect exists
- **Design**: Present scenarios where one aspect varies while others remain constant
- **Example**: "Which of these two situations differs in X?" or "What changes between scenario A and B?"
- **Feedback**: Explicitly identify what varied and what remained invariant; explain why the varying aspect matters

**2. Separation Questions** (Middle of sequence)
- **Purpose**: Isolate individual critical aspects so learners discern them independently
- **Design**: Systematically vary specific aspects to reveal their distinct effects
- **Example**: "How does changing X affect the outcome?" or "What happens when we vary Y while keeping Z constant?"
- **Feedback**: Show how the isolated aspect influences the whole; make its independent contribution clear

**3. Generalization Questions** (Middle to late)
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate that patterns hold across different contexts
- **Design**: Present the same principle or relationship in varied contexts or appearances
- **Example**: "Does this principle apply to [different context]?" or "What do these diverse examples have in common?"
- **Feedback**: Highlight the invariant pattern across varied appearances; show the underlying unity

**4. Fusion Questions** (Late in sequence)
- **Purpose**: Enable simultaneous awareness of multiple critical aspects
- **Design**: Vary several critical aspects at once, requiring integrated understanding
- **Example**: "Considering both X and Y, what happens when..." or "How do these multiple factors interact?"
- **Feedback**: Show how aspects interrelate; present the integrated, holistic understanding

#### Sequencing Principle

Structure question sequences following the developmental progression:
**Contrast → Separation → Generalization → Fusion**

Early questions help learners notice that aspects exist; middle questions separate and generalize them; late questions integrate them into comprehensive understanding.

### Question Types (Beyond Multiple Choice)

While pQBL research has focused on multiple-choice questions, the principles generalize to:

**Open-ended Questions**
- Require learners to formulate their own answers
- Feedback addresses multiple possible correct approaches
- Feedback identifies common misconceptions and why they're problematic

**Short Answer Questions**
- Ask for specific information, definitions, or explanations
- Feedback provides the complete answer with elaboration
- Feedback connects to broader concepts

**Problem-Solving Questions**
- Present scenarios requiring application of concepts
- Feedback shows complete solution process, not just final answer
- Feedback explains decision points and alternative approaches

**Reflective Questions**
- Prompt thinking about concepts, implications, or connections
- Feedback offers expert perspectives and frameworks for thinking
- Feedback introduces theories or research relevant to the reflection

**Comparison Questions**
- Ask learners to compare, contrast, or categorize
- Feedback reveals the critical distinctions or relationships
- Feedback provides the conceptual framework for understanding differences

### Question Quality Criteria

- **Appropriately Challenging**: Neither trivially simple nor misleadingly complex
- **Clear and Unambiguous**: Specify what type of response is expected
- **Avoid Negations**: Unless specifically needed to promote careful reading
- **Enable Feedback**: Structure questions so constructive feedback can address the learning goal
- **Focus on Key Concepts**: Each question targets critical aspects of understanding

## Feedback Architecture

### Essential Feedback Components

1. **Verification**: Acknowledge the response (correct/incorrect/partial)

2. **Explanation**: Explain why the response has that status

3. **Content Integration**: Present the learning material relevant to this question

4. **Variation and Invariance**: Explicitly identify what varied and what remained constant in the question; explain why the varying aspect is critical for understanding

5. **Connections**: Link to related concepts, prior knowledge, or upcoming material

6. **Elaboration**: Provide examples, applications, or deeper exploration

### Feedback for Open Questions

Since open questions lack predetermined answer options, feedback must:

- **Anticipate Common Responses**: Address the most likely correct and incorrect approaches
- **Provide Model Answers**: Offer expert-level responses as exemplars
- **Explain Reasoning**: Show the thought process, not just conclusions
- **Address Misconceptions**: Explicitly identify and correct common errors in thinking
- **Offer Multiple Perspectives**: When applicable, show that different valid approaches exist

### Feedback Strategies

**Personalization**: Tailor feedback to the specific response or response pattern

**Scaffolding**: For complex topics, feedback can pose follow-up questions that guide deeper thinking

**Resource Integration**: Feedback can reference additional materials for those wanting to explore further, though the feedback itself must be sufficient for learning

**Metacognitive Prompts**: Include guidance on how to think about or approach similar problems

## Implementation Guidelines

### Converting Traditional Content to pQBL Using Variation Theory

1. **Identify the Object of Learning**: What should learners understand by the end?

2. **Determine Critical Aspects**: What must learners discern to understand the object of learning? What dimensions of variation exist?

3. **Design Contrast Questions**: Create questions that help learners notice each critical aspect by experiencing what it is versus what it is not

4. **Design Separation Questions**: Create questions that isolate each critical aspect, showing its independent effect by varying it against invariant background

5. **Design Generalization Questions**: Create questions showing each critical aspect across different contexts, revealing invariant patterns

6. **Design Fusion Questions**: Create questions requiring simultaneous attention to multiple critical aspects and their interrelationships

7. **Write Rich Feedback**: For each question, develop feedback that:
   - Explicitly identifies what varied and what remained invariant
   - Explains why the varying aspect is critical
   - Contains the explanatory content about that aspect
   - Addresses why answers are correct or incorrect

8. **Sequence Using Variation Patterns**: Order questions following contrast → separation → generalization → fusion

9. **Test and Iterate**: Gather feedback on question clarity, feedback quality, and whether learners successfully discern the critical aspects

### Onboarding Learners

Since pQBL differs from familiar learning formats:

- **Explain the Approach**: Briefly describe how pQBL works and why
- **Normalize Uncertainty**: Acknowledge that not knowing answers initially is expected and beneficial
- **Demonstrate the Format**: Use example questions to show how to engage
- **Emphasize Feedback**: Encourage learners to read feedback carefully, even for correct answers

### Common Implementation Challenges

**Challenge**: Creating appropriately difficult questions
**Strategy**: Pilot with target learners and adjust based on response patterns

**Challenge**: Developing comprehensive feedback for open questions
**Strategy**: Collect actual student responses to identify common patterns to address

**Challenge**: Ensuring learners read feedback rather than rushing to next questions
**Strategy**: Design interfaces that require interaction with feedback; include valuable information in all feedback paths

**Challenge**: Learners searching external sources instead of attempting questions
**Strategy**: Frame questions as opportunities for discovery; emphasize learning value of attempting before knowing

## Advantages of pQBL

- **Active Engagement**: Learning is inherently active, not passive
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Smaller, focused modules rather than lengthy texts
- **Immediate Feedback**: Learning happens in context of the question
- **Efficient Production**: Less content to create than traditional materials plus separate assessments
- **Flexible Learning Paths**: Learners can focus on areas where they need support

## When to Apply pQBL

Use this approach when:
- Creating standalone learning modules
- Designing self-paced learning materials
- Converting traditional content to more active formats
- Emphasizing practical application over theoretical coverage
- Working with concepts that benefit from retrieval practice
- Targeting learners who benefit from immediate feedback
